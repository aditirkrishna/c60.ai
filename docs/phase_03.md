91. Build multi-modal dataset handler.
In /engine/multimodal_loader.py, support loading datasets with text, image, and tabular modalities. Use HuggingFace datasets, torchvision, and pandas together. Implement load_multimodal(dataset_id) function. Normalize and align modalities across samples. Store metadata in multimodal_manifest.json. Showcase pipeline construction with multi-modal features in /notebooks/86_multimodal_intro.ipynb.

92. Add modality-specific preprocessing pipelines.
In /nodes/preprocessors/, add TextCleanerNode, ImageResizerNode, and TextVectorizerNode. Attach modality tags to graph nodes. Allow hybrid graphs with image and text pipelines merging into tabular joins. Demonstrate preprocessing modularity in /notebooks/87_modality_nodes.ipynb.

93. Enable transformer-based modality embedding.
In /embedding/transformers.py, add support for using BERT (text) and ViT (images) to extract embeddings. Expose get_embeddings(df, col, type='text'). Store output in feature store and feed into pipelines. Evaluate effect of modality embeddings on final score in /notebooks/88_transformer_embedding.ipynb.

94. Implement self-debugging pipeline agent.
Create /debugger/self_debugger.py. This module runs diagnostics when a pipeline underperforms—e.g., "imbalance missed," "feature leak suspected." Use LLM + heuristics to generate hypotheses and suggest fixes. Store debug logs in debug_reports/. Demo self-debugging in /notebooks/89_self_debugger.ipynb.

95. Introduce pipeline repair and retry agent.
After debugging, automatically try repairing pipelines. Modify graph, remove problematic node, or reparameterize. In /engine/repair_agent.py, codify repair strategies. Track fixed score delta. Measure success rate of repair attempts in /notebooks/90_pipeline_repair.ipynb.

96. Build API wrapper for C60-as-a-Service.
Wrap core pipeline evaluation logic in FastAPI or Flask. In /interface/api.py, create endpoints: /predict, /suggest, /explain. Enable real-time pipeline scoring via REST. Host locally and with Docker. Include /notebooks/91_c60_api_demo.ipynb for walkthrough.

97. Enable cloud execution mode.
In /interface/cloud_runner.py, support offloading pipeline runs to AWS/GCP via containerized jobs. Include infrastructure module for launching EC2, GKE jobs. Store credentials, configs in infra/cloud_config.json. Build /notebooks/92_cloud_autoscaler.ipynb to demonstrate horizontal scaling.

98. Add continuous knowledge distillation.
In /memory/distiller.py, after each batch of top pipelines, retrain a distilled lightweight model (e.g., linear or small MLP) that approximates pipeline score. This model can act as a fast screening layer before full evaluation. Benchmark distillation effectiveness in /notebooks/93_knowledge_distillation.ipynb.

99. Integrate user feedback loop.
Enable user voting or preference tagging on generated pipelines. Store votes in user_feedback.json. In /engine/feedback_trainer.py, use this feedback to bias mutation/search and retrain scoring models. Show personalized pipeline shifts in /notebooks/94_feedback_loop.ipynb.

100. Finalize Phase 3 and plan enterprise deployment.
Wrap up Phase 3 with CI/CD pipeline linking repo → test → Docker → API → cloud run. Document full stack in /docs/deployment.md. Record Phase 3 summary video. Prep pitch deck and one-pager for C60 enterprise license. Phase 4 will target AutoCausal+Reinforcement scaling with knowledge graphs.
