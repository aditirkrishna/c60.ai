# C60.ai Manifesto

## Vision
C60.ai is an open-source AutoML framework developed as an undergraduate project to simplify and democratize machine learning for tabular data. Inspired by the elegance of the C60 fullerene molecule, it aims to create efficient, flexible, and transparent machine learning pipelines that adapt to diverse tasks. By combining graph-based pipeline design, meta-learning, and user-guided automation, C60.ai empowers both beginners and experts to build high-performing models with minimal effort.

## Goals
1. **Automate Pipeline Creation**: Generate optimized machine learning pipelines for classification and regression tasks using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to represent modular workflows.
2. **Enhance Efficiency**: Leverage meta-learning to store and reuse pipeline performance data, reducing computation time for similar tasks.
3. **Enable User Control**: Integrate user feedback loops to allow domain experts to guide pipeline optimization, balancing automation with human expertise.
4. **Promote Transparency**: Provide clear explanations of pipeline decisions, making the system accessible and trustworthy for all users.
5. **Ensure Scalability**: Support cloud deployment to handle large datasets, making C60.ai suitable for real-world applications.
6. **Foster Open-Source Collaboration**: Share the project on GitHub to encourage contributions from the community, showcasing undergraduate innovation.

## Scope
C60.ai focuses on tabular data, automating the following tasks:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading, validating, and preparing datasets.
- **Pipeline Generation**: Creating and optimizing pipelines using heuristic search algorithms.
- **Evaluation and Optimization**: Scoring pipeline performance and refining through meta-learning and user feedback.
- **User Interaction**: Offering a command-line interface for pipeline inspection and modification.
- **Deployment**: Supporting local and cloud deployment for practical use.

The project is designed to be lightweight and extensible, prioritizing simplicity for an undergraduate project while laying the foundation for future enhancements.

## Why C60.ai?
Unlike traditional AutoML frameworks, C60.ai stands out by:
- **Flexible Pipeline Design**: Graph-based pipelines adapt to complex tasks more effectively than rigid frameworks.
- **Meta-Learning**: Learns from past runs to improve future performance, a feature not fully exploited by many competitors.
- **User-Guided Automation**: Balances automation with expert input, ideal for domain-specific tasks.
- **Transparency**: Explains pipeline choices, building trust in regulated or critical applications.

C60.ai is a proof-of-concept for undergraduate research, demonstrating how innovative design can enhance AutoML accessibility and performance.

## Target Audience
- **Students and Beginners**: Easy-to-use interface and clear documentation for learning AutoML.
- **Data Scientists**: Flexible pipelines and user feedback for complex, domain-specific tasks.
- **Open-Source Contributors**: A welcoming platform for community-driven enhancements.

## Future Directions
As an undergrad project, C60.ai is a starting point. Future work could include:
- Support for additional data types (e.g., images, text).
- Advanced optimization techniques (e.g., genetic algorithms).
- Enhanced cloud integration for enterprise use.

Join us in building the future of AutoML!
