51. Begin Phase 2: LLM reasoning and causal constraint logic.
Create /llm_reasoning/ directory. This phase adds reasoning-driven pipeline generation using LLMs. Begin by creating reasoning_driver.py, which takes a dataset fingerprint and outputs high-level decisions like "likely imbalanced," "requires PCA," etc. The first version will use templated rules and later integrate OpenAI or local LLMs. Document this architecture and intent in /notebooks/46_phase2_intro.ipynb.

52. Build prompt templates for LLM-based reasoning.
In /llm_reasoning/prompts.py, define templates for few-shot LLM prompting. Each prompt includes: task type, data summary, previous pipeline metadata, and expected output as YAML with suggested modules and order. Include examples for classification, regression, and time series. Store prompt logs for analysis. Demonstrate template coverage in /notebooks/47_prompt_templates.ipynb.

53. Integrate OpenAI or HuggingFace LLM API wrapper.
Implement /llm_reasoning/llm_wrapper.py. Support OpenAI (via openai lib) and HuggingFace Transformers (local models). Provide query_llm(prompt, model="gpt-4") interface. Handle retries and rate limits. Include logging and cost estimates. Validate output formatting and error handling in /notebooks/48_llm_wrapper_tests.ipynb.

54. Build LLM-guided graph proposal module.
In /llm_reasoning/llm_planner.py, take LLM output YAML and convert it into a valid pipeline graph structure using existing GraphBuilder. Enforce schema checks. Annotate each node with "source: LLM". Store these special graphs in /memory/llm_proposals/. Visualize output of LLM-driven design in /notebooks/49_llm_graph_build.ipynb.

55. Evaluate LLM-proposed pipelines.
Run full evaluation (compile, score) on LLM-generated pipeline graphs. Compare performance vs GNN-evolved pipelines. Store results in llm_vs_mutation_comparison.csv. Visualize win rates, quality gaps in /notebooks/50_llm_vs_mutation.ipynb. This benchmark determines when LLMs improve design vs random mutation.

56. Add causal graph engine for dataset interpretation.
In /causal/causal_graph.py, use causal-learn or dowhy to extract causal DAGs from tabular data. Create get_causal_structure(df) which returns edge list of cause-effect variable relationships. Add support for interventions. Save DAG as .dot and .json. Demo with real dataset in /notebooks/51_causal_graph_demo.ipynb.

57. Integrate causal constraints into graph validator.
In /engine/safety_validator.py, add optional check that pipeline transformations do not violate causal ordering (e.g., predicting future from past). Use causal graph to prevent leakage. Create a toggle in config for "causal_safe_mode". Visualize rejected pipelines in /notebooks/52_causal_constraints.ipynb.

58. Enable LLM + causal hybrid reasoning.
Modify reasoning_driver.py to include causal DAG metadata in the LLM prompt. This allows the LLM to incorporate structural variable relationships in its decisions. Add prompt examples for causal-aware reasoning. Compare output quality with and without causal info in /notebooks/53_llm_with_causality.ipynb.

59. Add dataset quality assessment module.
In /engine/data_quality.py, assess class imbalance, redundancy, cardinality explosion, missingness, outliers. Score each on 0–1 scale. Provide tags like "high cardinality categorical," "low sample per class". Store assessments in quality_report.json. Feed these tags into LLM reasoning. Walk through this pipeline in /notebooks/54_data_quality.ipynb.

60. Build LLM-driven mutation engine.
In /llm_reasoning/llm_mutator.py, use LLMs to suggest mutations based on graph JSON input. Prompt example: “Given this pipeline, suggest a modification to improve generalization.” Receive updated YAML or mutation delta. Validate legality and apply. Compare mutation types chosen by LLM vs evolution. Show example queries in /notebooks/55_llm_mutator.ipynb.

61. Train graph embedding model for latent structure discovery.
In /embedding/graph2vec.py, use graph2vec or Node2Vec on pipeline DAGs to produce latent 128D vectors per graph. These embeddings capture structural similarity beyond fingerprints. Save to latent_vectors.json. Compare embeddings vs fingerprints via cosine similarity in /notebooks/56_graph_embeddings.ipynb. Used for hybrid similarity search and diversity analysis.

62. Add pipeline diversity scorer.
In /engine/diversity_scorer.py, compute diversity of a pipeline population based on latent vector dispersion. Use average pairwise distance (cosine or Euclidean) as diversity metric. Add a toggle to include diversity bonus in search score: score_total = perf + α * diversity. Explore impact in /notebooks/57_diversity_analysis.ipynb.

63. Design novelty detector for pipeline exploration.
Implement /engine/novelty_tracker.py to compare every new pipeline’s latent vector to existing memory. Flag pipelines that cross a novelty threshold. Optionally prioritize scoring novel configurations. Store novelty map in outputs/novelty_map.json. Demonstrate novelty-guided search in /notebooks/58_novelty_guided.ipynb.

64. Introduce reinforcement learning pipeline grower.
In /engine/rl_grower.py, model pipeline construction as a reinforcement problem. State = partial graph, action = add node or edge. Reward = validation score. Use PPO or DQN with graph embeddings as inputs. Train on synthetic tasks. Describe RL setup in /notebooks/59_rl_pipeline_grower.ipynb.

65. Build pipeline grammar encoder-decoder model.
In /llm_reasoning/grammar_model.py, tokenize pipeline DAGs into sequences and train a Transformer encoder-decoder to learn valid pipeline syntax. Use it to sample new configurations and complete partial graphs. Train using memory data. Visualize grammar model outputs in /notebooks/60_pipeline_grammar.ipynb.

66. Add concept bottleneck nodes to DAG.
Allow nodes to output interpretable concepts (e.g., imbalance→encoding→tree bias). In graph_schema.py, define ConceptNode types. These help explain why a pipeline performs well/poorly. Store explanations alongside graphs. Build interactive explainer in /notebooks/61_concept_bottlenecks.ipynb.

67. Add semantic graph constraint checker.
Enhance /engine/safety_validator.py to include semantic rules: e.g., "don’t normalize target," "avoid PCA on categorical." Encode these as logical constraints. Use Z3 solver or rule-based checks. Log violations and auto-correct if possible. Document semantic filtering in /notebooks/62_semantic_constraints.ipynb.

68. Build few-shot pipeline synthesis using LLM memory.
Create /llm_reasoning/few_shot_synthesizer.py. Use examples from memory as few-shot contexts for LLM. Generate new pipeline YAMLs by prompting: "Given these examples, propose a pipeline for a similar dataset." Score and validate output. Compare one-shot vs few-shot synthesis in /notebooks/63_few_shot_pipeline.ipynb.

69. Create latent diversity explorer tool.
Visualize all pipeline latent vectors in 2D using UMAP. Color-code by score, novelty, or source (GNN, LLM, RL). Build latent_explorer.py inside /interface/. Enable interactive browsing of latent pipeline space. Demonstrate explorer on 500+ pipeline run in /notebooks/64_latent_explorer.ipynb.

70. Build reinforcement critic using GNN.
In /engine/rl_critic.py, train a GNN to serve as a reward critic. Given a partial pipeline graph, predict expected score. Use this model to guide RL Grower agent decisions. Compare critic-guided exploration vs random rollouts in /notebooks/65_gnn_critic_rl.ipynb. In /llm_reasoning/llm_mutator.py, use LLMs to suggest mutations based on graph JSON input. Prompt example: “Given this pipeline, suggest a modification to improve generalization.” Receive updated YAML or mutation delta. Validate legality and apply. Compare mutation types chosen by LLM vs evolution. Show example queries in /notebooks/55_llm_mutator.ipynb.
