    "\n",
    "### Over-Engineering Observations\n",
    "- The project plan is extremely ambitious, with hundreds of advanced features (GNNs, LLMs, RL, causal inference, generative agents, etc.).\n",
    "- Many features are planned before core functionality is validated.\n",
    "- Some modules may overlap (e.g., multiple mutation engines, several types of explainers, various embedding and scoring modules).\n",
    "- The plan risks 'analysis paralysis' or never reaching a stable MVP due to the sheer scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions for Simplification\n",
    "- **Prioritize a Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Focus on core pipeline search, mutation, and scoring before adding LLMs, RL, or generative agents.\n",
    "- **Modularize:** Ensure each advanced feature is a plug-in, not a core dependency.\n",
    "- **Defer advanced features:** Only implement GNNs, RL, and generative agents after the basic system is robust and tested.\n",
    "- **Regularly review and prune the roadmap:** Remove or merge overlapping modules.\n",
    "- **Use Jupyter Notebooks for rapid prototyping and demonstration, as planned.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justifications\n",
    "- Simplifying the initial implementation will make the system easier to test, debug, and extend.\n",
    "- Modular design allows for easier maintenance and onboarding of new contributors.\n",
    "- Focusing on core value first ensures the project delivers usable results early, increasing the chance of adoption and feedback."

    "1. **Phase 1: Core MVP**\n",
    "   - Implement dataset loader, pipeline graph schema, validator, and basic mutation/search loop.\n",
    "   - Use Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate each module.\n",
    "   - Write tests for all core modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Phase 2: Incremental Feature Addition**\n",
    "   - Add meta-learning, memory, and scoring enhancements.\n",
    "   - Integrate simple visualizations and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Optional, Modular)**\n",
    "   - Add GNN predictor, LLM reasoning, RL-based mutation, and generative agents as optional plug-ins.\n",
    "   - Each advanced feature should be in its own module, with clear interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Continuous Review**\n",
    "   - After each phase, review for unnecessary complexity or overlap.\n",
    "   - Use feedback from notebooks and tests to guide next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Guide for Code Changes\n",
    "- Start with the core modules as outlined in phase_01.md.\n",
    "- For each new feature, create a separate module and notebook demo.\n",
    "- Use configuration files to enable/disable advanced features.\n",
    "- Regularly refactor to remove redundancy and improve clarity.\n",
