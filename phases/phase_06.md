Always wrap code in triple backticks with language specified.

141. Start Phase 06: Optimization, Stress Testing & Final Publication.

142. Implement runtime profiler across pipeline stages.
In /diagnostics/runtime_profiler.py, add decorators to log time, memory, and compute usage per pipeline node. Support profiling modes: CPU, GPU, RAM, IO. Visualize performance bottlenecks in /notebooks/134_runtime_profiling.ipynb. Store logs in perf_logs/.

143. Optimize memory footprint with smart caching.
In /engine/cache_manager.py, implement intermediate result caching and smart reuse across pipeline runs. Use hash-based node fingerprints. Track cache hit ratio and memory savings. Demonstrate reduced RAM profile in /notebooks/135_cache_optimization.ipynb.

144. Add GPU acceleration backend.
In /engine/gpu_adapter.py, implement GPU-accelerated versions of supported nodes using PyTorch, CuML, and RAPIDS. Include GPU-enabled pipeline templates. Benchmark GPU vs CPU time in /notebooks/136_gpu_speedup.ipynb.

145. Build model uncertainty quantification module.
In /interpretability/uncertainty.py, use Monte Carlo dropout and bootstrapped ensembles to estimate prediction confidence per pipeline. Output confidence histograms and calibration plots. Demo in /notebooks/137_model_uncertainty.ipynb.

146. Integrate Shapley-based explanation for DAGs.
Use SHAP and integrated gradients to analyze feature importances for each node’s output. In /interpretability/dag_shap.py, create composite explanations per pipeline. Compare explainability scores in /notebooks/138_dag_explanations.ipynb.

147. Implement adversarial robustness tests.
In /stress/adversarial_test.py, create adversarial examples by corrupting input features or swapping labels. Evaluate degradation and recovery. Include stress leaderboard. Demonstrate in /notebooks/139_adversarial_stress.ipynb.

148. Add data poisoning and leak detection.
Create /stress/poison_detector.py to test pipelines against poisoned datasets (e.g., mislabeled training samples). Detect and flag suspicious patterns. Use LLM-assisted traceback for source discovery. Include demo in /notebooks/140_poisoning_tests.ipynb.

149. Build fuzzing engine for stress automation.
In /stress/fuzzer.py, generate randomized pipelines, configurations, and inputs to test failure boundaries. Store crash logs in fuzz_reports/. Track fuzz coverage over time. Include fuzz stats notebook /notebooks/141_pipeline_fuzzing.ipynb.

150. Create pipeline resilience dashboard.
Design /interface/resilience_dashboard.py, a UI to show each pipeline’s performance under noise, drift, scale, and adversarial conditions. Include interpretability, uncertainty, and runtime metrics. Snapshot results in /notebooks/142_resilience_overview.ipynb.

151. Finalize CI/CD with reproducibility tracking.
In /infra/cicd.py, build GitHub Actions + DVC pipelines for automatic testing, scoring, and release generation. Store runs in reproducibility_log.json. Include /docs/reproducibility.md. Auto-generate notebook diffs to ensure result consistency.

152. Prepare formal model cards and datasheets.
Generate /docs/model_cards/ and /docs/datasheets/ per pipeline template. Include data use, fairness, explainability, performance, and intended use. Align with Google Model Card framework. Link from dashboard UI.

153. Train multilingual documentation summarizer.
Use LLM to generate cross-lingual docs. In /language/multilang_docs.py, translate /README.md and selected notebooks into Hindi, French, Spanish, Mandarin. Store in /docs/i18n/. Evaluate summarization accuracy in /notebooks/143_translation_demo.ipynb.

154. Add performance-aware mutation controller.
In /engine/mutation_controller.py, use real-time feedback to avoid mutations that historically degrade speed or RAM. Add mutation penalties based on performance budget. Plot mutation score vs compute in /notebooks/144_performance_mutation.ipynb.

155. Benchmark cross-dataset generalization.
In /experiments/cross_generalization.py, test pipelines on unseen datasets from UCI, Kaggle, and custom corpora. Track score drop, recovery time, and successful adaptation rate. Include matrix plot in /notebooks/145_cross_domain_tests.ipynb.

156. Publish paper-ready benchmark report.
Generate /reports/c60_benchmark.pdf including all major experiments: causal evolution, generative DAGs, adversarial robustness, and explainability. Include all Phase 6 results. Auto-generate from LaTeX + notebook outputs.

157. Build c60.ai deployment toolkit.
Package core modules into installable package /deploy/c60toolkit/. Include CLI (c60 run ...), API, and UI. Build install demo in /notebooks/146_deploy_toolkit.ipynb. Publish to PyPI for open source use.

158. Integrate model monitoring hooks.
In /monitoring/hooks.py, add API/webhooks to log live predictions, performance drift, and user feedback from deployed models. Store in monitoring_db.sqlite. Demo with dummy stream in /notebooks/147_model_monitoring.ipynb.

159. Launch public leaderboard server.
Host /interface/leaderboard.py as web app to compare pipeline submissions by accuracy, novelty, robustness, etc. Allow pipeline upload and rerun via API. Include deployment doc /docs/leaderboard_hosting.md.

160. Finalize Phase 06 milestone: publish v1.0 release.
Create /release/v1.0/ directory with zipped codebase, instructions, changelog, and license. Submit arXiv draft, update GitHub repo, publish demo video. Celebrate C60's completion. This milestone locks a full-stack AutoML framework from seed to system.

Steps 161–200 will include large-scale experiments, whitepaper publishing, and strategic extensions like neural compression, memory distillation, or enterprise adaptation. Ready to proceed.
