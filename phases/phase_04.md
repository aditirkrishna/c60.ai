01. Start Phase 04: AutoCausal + Reinforcement Scaling.
Create a new folder /phase4_autocausal/. This phase focuses on causal reinforcement learning, knowledge graph synthesis, and scalable policy evolution. Begin with /phase4_autocausal/README.md outlining the goal: “Intelligently evolve causal-compliant pipelines with feedback-guided agents.” Set up /notebooks/95_phase4_overview.ipynb to narrate scope.

102. Implement causal reward engine.
In /phase4_autocausal/causal_rewards.py, define rewards that account for causal correctness, structural compliance, and counterfactual validity. Combine these with score/robustness for RL agent reward shaping. Enable reward tuning via reward_profile.json. Visualize reward surfaces in /notebooks/96_causal_reward_landscape.ipynb.

103. Build knowledge graph of pipeline decisions.
In /phase4_autocausal/knowledge_graph.py, represent all pipeline decisions (mutations, LLM edits, scores) as RDF triples using rdflib. Ex: (node_type, improved_by, mutation_73). Store graph_store.ttl. Enable SPARQL queries. Use graph to trace evolution history. Demonstrate graph queries in /notebooks/97_knowledge_graph.ipynb.

104. Add reinforcement-guided mutation policy.
Train a reinforcement learner using the causal reward engine to prioritize mutation paths that preserve causality. Use PPO or A2C in /phase4_autocausal/rl_mutator.py. State = graph + quality + causal state. Action = mutate edge/node. Train with memory logs. Compare policy vs random in /notebooks/98_rl_mutator.ipynb.

105. Introduce counterfactual pipeline synthesis.
In /phase4_autocausal/counterfactual.py, given a successful pipeline and a failed variant, learn to generate a counterfactual “repair” graph. Use encoder-decoder GNN with difference vectors. Store recovered graphs in counterfactual_trials/. Run repair simulations in /notebooks/99_counterfactual_synthesis.ipynb.

106. Integrate DoWhy and econml for effect estimation.
Enhance causal modules using dowhy and econml for treatment effect estimation. In /causal/treatment_effects.py, compute CATE, ATT per feature. Use these for feature selection guidance in the pipeline. Evaluate influence of causal effect filtering in /notebooks/100_treatment_effects.ipynb.

107. Build temporal-causal fusion model.
In /phase4_autocausal/temp_causal_fusion.py, combine seasonality patterns with causal DAGs to form hybrid features for time-series datasets. Use Fourier + DAG constraints. Create forecasting pipelines that respect causal ordering. Test fusion pipelines in /notebooks/101_temp_causal_fusion.ipynb.

108. Design cross-pipeline causal meta-learner.
Train a GNN that takes multiple pipelines and learns which causal patterns correlate with generalizability. In /phase4_autocausal/causal_meta_learner.py, input causal fingerprints and output expected lift. Store insights in causal_rules.json. Demonstrate rule learning in /notebooks/102_causal_meta_learning.ipynb.

109. Enable graph program synthesis from scratch.
Implement /phase4_autocausal/graph_synthesizer.py that generates new DAGs from scratch using policy + causal grammar rules. No evolutionary seed. Create a DAG synthesis policy model using transformer decoder or RL. Compare from-scratch DAGs with evolved ones in /notebooks/103_graph_synthesis.ipynb.

110. Incorporate curriculum learning in RL evolution.
In /phase4_autocausal/curriculum.py, gradually introduce pipeline complexity to the RL learner—start with 3-node graphs and scale. Improve stability and convergence. Log curriculum stages and performance improvement. Show curriculum impact in /notebooks/104_rl_curriculum.ipynb.

111. Add causal contradiction detector.
In /phase4_autocausal/causal_checker.py, detect contradictory causal logic in generated pipelines (e.g., inferring target from descendant). Encode symbolic rules and verify DAGs before training. Auto-reject invalid DAGs. Evaluate rejection statistics in /notebooks/105_causal_contradictions.ipynb.

112. Build inverse causality explorer.
Implement tool to hypothesize “what if” scenarios—e.g., reversing target and input roles. In /interface/inverse_explorer.py, allow experimentation with causal inversion. Record which transformations break or preserve performance. Demonstrate counterintuitive patterns in /notebooks/106_inverse_causality.ipynb.

113. Create reinforcement-augmented LLM planning.
In /phase4_autocausal/rl_guided_llm.py, integrate RL reward into LLM prompting—feedback from failed graphs influences future LLM responses. Fine-tune prompt construction dynamically. Compare static vs adaptive LLM planners in /notebooks/107_rl_guided_llm.ipynb.

114. Enable causal operator embedding.
Represent each graph node’s causal utility as a vector. In /embedding/causal_embedding.py, learn embeddings based on contribution to causal validity, generalization, and repair rate. Use in GNN inputs and memory filtering. Visualize operator map in /notebooks/108_causal_embeddings.ipynb.

115. Add explainable agent episode recorder.
Record full agent decision trace with rationale, LLM prompt, causal check, reward scores. In /interface/episode_logger.py, output per-run JSON with searchable episode traces. Enables debugging of agent policy evolution. Visualize episodes in /notebooks/109_episode_logs.ipynb.

116. Train policy conditioned on causal frontier.
In /phase4_autocausal/frontier_policy.py, define "causal frontier" as the boundary between valid and invalid pipelines. Train an agent that pushes the boundary without crossing it. Enables discovery of edge-case but valid DAGs. Illustrate frontier region in /notebooks/110_causal_frontier.ipynb.

117. Build causal benchmarking suite.
In /experiments/causal_benchmarks.py, compile datasets with ground truth causal graphs. Include tuebingen, sachs, and simulated ones. Compare AutoML pipelines with vs without causal alignment. Generate leaderboard in /notebooks/111_causal_benchmarks.ipynb.

118. Add safety assurance guardrails.
Define /phase4_autocausal/safety.py to implement hard rules that reject graphs violating domain-specific causal assumptions. E.g., “treatment precedes outcome,” “cannot leak from future.” Use these guardrails during mutation and LLM generation. Evaluate rejections in /notebooks/112_causal_safety.ipynb.

119. Publish knowledge graph snapshot.
Export RDF pipeline evolution graph as a public .ttl and .nt file. Host queryable version on a local endpoint using GraphDB or Blazegraph. Link queries to notebook results. Document RDF schema in /docs/knowledge_graph.md. Explore graph in /notebooks/113_kg_snapshot.ipynb.

120. Finalize Phase 04 with whitepaper draft.
Summarize Phase 04 in /docs/whitepaper_draft.md: causal scaffolding, reinforcement shaping, knowledge graph evolution. Include pipeline examples, evolution trajectories, reward trends. Link to benchmark results and RDF graph. This document seeds the AutoCausal research paper and enterprise pitch.
