Always wrap code in triple backticks with language specified.

121. Start Phase 05: Generative Intelligence & Self-Assembly.
Create /phase5_generative/README.md describing the goal: develop agents that autonomously generate novel pipeline graphs based on high-level intent, with no dataset as input. Launch /notebooks/114_phase5_intro.ipynb to set the theoretical context: language → graph → performance trajectory.

122. Implement high-level goal parser.
In /phase5_generative/intent_parser.py, parse user prompts like “maximize stability on low-signal datasets” or “design resilient time-series forecaster” into structured intents. Define output spec: task_type, data_condition, design_constraints. Connect parsed intents to graph generation seeds. Demo in /notebooks/115_goal_to_graph.ipynb.

123. Build transformer-based graph decoder.
Train a decoder that maps parsed goals to DAGs. In /phase5_generative/graph_decoder.py, use a transformer with causal masking to generate pipeline sequences. Input = intent vector. Output = ordered node construction. Fine-tune on memory of successful pipelines. Evaluate zero-shot synthesis in /notebooks/116_transformer_decoder.ipynb.

124. Create self-assembly graph engine.
In /phase5_generative/self_assembler.py, implement bottom-up assembly of pipelines using node embeddings. Nodes with high semantic compatibility connect probabilistically. Create energy-based assembly rules. Store assembled DAGs in autograph_trials/. Compare learned vs handcrafted graphs in /notebooks/117_self_assembly.ipynb.

125. Add hallucination detector for generative graphs.
In /engine/sanity_check.py, detect structural errors or implausible DAGs in generated graphs. Use heuristics: cycles, data leakage, invalid joins. Add LLM critique as secondary sanity layer. Mark hallucinated graphs and block from scoring. Visualize rejection rates in /notebooks/118_hallucination_scan.ipynb.

126. Train pipeline embedding encoder.
In /embedding/pipeline2vec.py, train a model to embed DAGs into vector space representing function, complexity, and style. Use GNN or TreeLSTM. Enable similarity-based graph retrieval and clustering. Store pipeline_vectors.npy. Visualize latent space in /notebooks/119_pipeline_embedding.ipynb.

127. Enable zero-data pipeline prediction.
In /interface/zerodata_predictor.py, allow users to enter goals like “robust classifier for volatile signals” and return graph suggestions from embedding space. No training data required. Retrieve from vector DB (faiss). Compare against fine-tuned transformers in /notebooks/120_zero_data_generation.ipynb.

128. Build generative style transfer agent.
In /phase5_generative/style_transfer.py, allow transforming a given pipeline into the style of another (e.g., robust → fast, causal → heuristic). Use latent vector interpolation or graph rewrites. Enable via CLI: --transfer_style from:fast to:interpretable. Evaluate transformations in /notebooks/121_style_transfer.ipynb.

129. Implement latent space DAG interpolator.
Enable smooth interpolation between pipeline DAGs. In /phase5_generative/graph_morpher.py, linearly blend pipeline embeddings, decode intermediates back to graphs. Explore evolution trajectories across styles. Store morph chains in morph_logs/. Visualize interpolated DAGs in /notebooks/122_graph_morphing.ipynb.

130. Add generative introspection scorer.
Create /engine/gen_introspection.py to score generative pipelines on novelty, diversity, plausibility, and distance from training set. Normalize scores for leaderboard. Highlight unusually creative or risky graphs. Compare human-like vs machine-only traits in /notebooks/123_gen_scores.ipynb.

//Phase 05: Steps 121–130 are now added. This phase marks the shift to:

Generative pipeline design from high-level intent

Transformer and self-assembly DAG generation

Hallucination detection and latent space manipulation

Zero-data prediction and graph style transfer//

131. Build self-rewriting pipeline agent.
In /phase5_generative/self_rewriter.py, develop an agent that identifies weak points in a pipeline (e.g., bottlenecks, redundancy) and autonomously rewrites that subgraph. Use introspection metrics + local search. Evaluate score delta per rewrite in /notebooks/124_self_rewriting.ipynb.

132. Add agent hallucination tracker.
Track which pipeline agents (LLM, GNN, transformer) are generating invalid or failed graphs. In /diagnostics/hallucination_tracker.py, log hallucination frequency and type. Visualize hallucination heatmaps by agent and prompt type. Include /notebooks/125_hallucination_agent_map.ipynb.

133. Enable personality-driven agent styles.
Assign generative agents personality tags (e.g., explorer, minimalist, resilient). In /phase5_generative/personality_traits.py, define biases and mutation strategies. Allow user to specify style via CLI. Compare outputs from diverse personalities in /notebooks/126_personality_profiles.ipynb.

134. Train auto-summarizer for generated DAGs.
In /interface/dag_summarizer.py, use LLM to generate one-paragraph plain-English descriptions of each generated pipeline. Store summaries with DAG metadata. Index searchable text in vector DB. Demo summaries in /notebooks/127_dag_summaries.ipynb.

135. Build feedback-gated generator loop.
Integrate user feedback into generative agent reinforcement. In /phase5_generative/feedback_loop.py, rank generated DAGs, discard low-rated structures, and favor agents/patterns with high approval. Visualize evolving feedback loop in /notebooks/128_feedback_gating.ipynb.

136. Construct generative novelty frontier.
In /phase5_generative/novelty_frontier.py, compute Pareto frontier between novelty and performance for generative DAGs. Visualize tradeoff surface. Mark “wild but good” vs “safe and stale” designs. Explore frontier shift across generations in /notebooks/129_novelty_frontier.ipynb.

137. Add generative beam search controller.
Create /engine/beam_search.py to manage breadth-first DAG generation with bounded novelty or performance criteria. Beam = top-k graph continuations. Enables efficient exploration of promising design regions. Benchmark vs random mutation in /notebooks/130_beam_search_demo.ipynb.

138. Implement DAG mutation attribution.
Track mutation lineage for each generated graph—what mutation/agent caused which part of the pipeline. In /diagnostics/mutation_attribution.py, store per-node provenance. Useful for debugging and reinforcement credit assignment. Analyze provenance maps in /notebooks/131_mutation_lineage.ipynb.

139. Train GPT-style decoder to explain DAGs.
Fine-tune a decoder on graph-text pairs to produce natural language explanations of novel pipelines. In /language/dag_explainer.py, connect graph embeddings to sentence templates. Helps in automatic documentation. Evaluate explanation quality in /notebooks/132_gpt_dag_explainer.ipynb.

140. Finalize Phase 05 and prepare generator benchmark.
Wrap up Phase 05 with a full benchmark suite in /experiments/generative_eval.py: novelty vs score, hallucination rate, goal success rate, time-to-solution. Prepare /docs/generative_whitepaper.md detailing architecture, training data, use cases, and results.
